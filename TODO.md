In Progress:
- Support large CDI games (e.g. Sonic Adventure 2)
    - Sonic Adventure 2 fails. According to `cdrdao` It looks like that its putting the first track of first session 150 sectors later that it should. Pregap should be at offset -150, but its at offset 0.


- Support CDIs where both sessions are Mode 2 Form 1 XA (e.g. Crazy Taxi, Jet Grind Radio)
    - Working branch for this support is in branch `dual_mode2_sessions`
    - Got burning to work with cdrecord utility.  Had to:
        1) Save out each session as a separate ISO files, but each ISO file was trimmed by 4096 bytes (2 sectors).  I have no idea why, but found that cdirip did this.
        2) Run `cdrecord -v -eject -multi first_session.iso`.
        3) Put disc back in
        4) Run `cdrecord -v -eject -multi second_session.iso`.
        - Don't think I was able to get it to work without ejecting, but need to try again.
    - Does not work with the macOS DiscRecording library with block size of 2048.  When trying to burn, the burn fails saying that it could not communicate with  CD burner and might have been disconnected. Try another CD burner?
    - The burn does not fail when using a block size of 2336 or 2056, but both yield a coaster(non-playable disc).
    - `cdrecord` does not use the DiscRecording libaray, but instead communicates directly to the drive via (IOKit)[https://github.com/Distrotech/cdrtools/blob/8adb0d06e070464f13d017b1de7187bf23dacd87/libscg/scsi-mac-iokit.c].
    - Might have to abandon DiscRecording and try the direct approach?
    - Also tried spitting out the ISO files (both with and without the 2 sector cut) and burning them via the Burn app.  The burn goes through, but yields a coaster.
    - Also tried `cdrecord` with bin/cue files generated by `cdirip`, and the first burn works, but then the second one fails saying the drive rejected the cue file.


- Support older versioned CDI games
- Write a Cocoa GUI
- Custom Arena-backed CFAllocator 

Done:
-  Better progress indicator
-  Use Notification Center and CFRunLoop instead of looping and checking status
